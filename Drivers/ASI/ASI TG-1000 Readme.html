<h4>5. Installation Instructions</h4>
<para>Even though ASI's drivers are not part of National Instrument's "Instrument Driver Network"
they have been designed to act the same way, so these instructions are similar to those found at 
<a href="http://www.ni.com/devzone/idnet/inetinst.htm">http://www.ni.com/devzone/idnet/inetinst.htm</a>.
<ol>
<li>Exit LabView if it is running
<li>Locate the instrument driver folder at &lt;LabVIEW&gt;\instr.lib folder, where &lt;LabVIEW&gt; is the install directory.  
The install directory can be found in LabView by going to Tools &gt;&gt; Options, then under Paths
and Default Directory.  An example location of the is C:\Program Files (x86)\National Instruments\LabVIEW 2011\instr.lib.
<li>Unzip the driver archive in the instr.lib folder.  The contents of &lt;LabVIEW&gt;\instr.lib\ASI TG-1000 should be:
<ul>
<li>Examples
<li>Private
<li>Public
<li>ASI TG-1000 Readme.html
<li>ASI TG-1000.aliases
<li>ASI TG-1000.lvlib
<li>ASI TG-1000.lvproj
</ul>
<li>Launch LabView
<li>Open any block diagram and open the functions palette.  The ASI TG-1000 VIs should be found under
Instrument I/O &gt;&gt; Instr Drivers &gt;&gt; ASI TG-1000.
